The crosstool-NG project aims to provide a stable, easy-to-build tool chain. A tool chain is a set of tools, including GCC, that allows you to build an application for a different architecture than the one you are building on. As part of crosstool-NG it will take care of downloading and configuring parts of the tool chain for your selected architecture. The tool chain will include the binutils tool and some C libraries that are specific to your target architecture. Crosstool-NG also has a very nice ncurses menu system that will easily allow you to build a tool chain.
